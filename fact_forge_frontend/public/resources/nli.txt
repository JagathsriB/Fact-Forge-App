## How Natural Language Inference (NLI) Works

The Natural Language Inference (NLI) check determines the logical relationship between the user's input text and the content from the top web source found. It answers the question: "Does the information in this web source support, contradict, or is it neutral to the claims made in my text?"

### 1. The Core Model

This check relies on a powerful, pre-trained language model specifically designed for understanding textual relationships.

* **Model:** The system uses a **`roberta-large-mnli`** model, which has been fine-tuned on the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI) corpus.

### 2. The NLI Process

The model is presented with two pieces of text:

* **Premise:** The text from the top web source.
* **Hypothesis:** The user's input text.

The model then analyzes these two texts to determine their logical connection.

### 3. The Verdicts

The NLI check produces one of three possible verdicts, along with a confidence score:

* **ENTAILMENT:** The information in the web source **supports or proves** the claim in the user's text.
* **CONTRADICTION:** The information in the web source **disproves or contradicts** the claim in the user's text.
* **NEUTRAL:** The information in the web source is on the same topic but is **not logically related** enough to either support or contradict the user's text.
